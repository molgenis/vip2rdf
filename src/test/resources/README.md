A usecase where a single patient vcf/samplesheet is processed.

This subset contains manually curated subsets from the [Ensembl glossary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ensembl/ensembl-glossary/master/ensembl-glossary.owl) ([license](https://www.ensembl.org/info/about/legal/disclaimer.html)) and the [Human Phenotype Ontology](https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology/releases/latest/download/hp.owl) ([license](https://hpo.jax.org/app/license)) to reduce filesizes and minimize the testing scale to what is purely necessary.
